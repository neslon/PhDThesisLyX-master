What is Loren Ipsum2?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry
 (see Section
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:1.3"

\end_inset

).
 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
 make a type specimen book 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AAB95,Con78"

\end_inset

.
 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
 typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
 It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
 Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
 like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

Fourier Series
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 you can write the Fourier Series:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}e^{inx},
\]

\end_inset

where the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

are given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)e^{inx}dx
\]

\end_inset

Maxwell's Equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four of the buggers, and I like them in terms of total charge
 and current:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cc}
\nabla.\mathbf{E}=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}} & \nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\\
\nabla.\mathbf{B}=0 & \nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_{o}\mathbf{J}+\mu_{0}\varepsilon_{0}\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

Where 
\series bold
B 
\series default
is the magnetic field, 
\series bold
E 
\series default
is the electric field and 
\series bold
J 
\series default
is the total current density.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the permittivity of free space (electric constant) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the permeability of free space (magnetic constant).

\begin_layout Section
Why do we use Loren Ipsum?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
 content of a page when looking at its layout.
 The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distributio
n of letters, as opposed to using `Content here, content here', making it
 look like readable English.
 Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
 as their default model text, and a search for `lorem ipsum' will uncover
 many web sites still in their infancy.
 Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
 on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Where does it come from?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
 It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
 it over 2000 years old.
 Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
 looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
 Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
 discovered the undoubtable source.
 Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
 et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
 This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
 Renaissance.
 The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from
 a line in section 1.10.32.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
 for those interested.
 Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ``de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero
 are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
 versions from the 1914 translation by H.
 Rackham

Section 1.10.32 of ``de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1914 translation by H.
 Rackham: ``But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
 pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account
 of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
 the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
 No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
 but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
 consequences that are extremely painful.
 Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
 of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
 in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
 To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
 exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
 to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
 consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 1.10.33 of ``de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in
 45 BC: ``At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui
 blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores
 et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique
 sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum
 fuga.
 Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio.
 Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit
 quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda
 est, omnis dolor repellendus.
 Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus
 saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae.
 Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptati
bus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1914 translation by H.
 Rackham: ``On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
 dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure
 of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
 and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
 fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
 through shrinking from toil and pain.
 These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
 In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
 prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
 welcomed and every pain avoided.
 But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
 of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
 and annoyances accepted.
 The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
 of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or
 else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
